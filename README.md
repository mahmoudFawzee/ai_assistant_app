# ai_assistant_app

This project will integrate AI capabilities into a Flutter app,
providing conversational functionality and useful features like reminders and weather updates.

# Key Features
Chat Interface: A user-friendly interface for interacting with the assistant.
    #todo:here we will divide chats
    #each chat has a title and when we entered a chat
     we will get all messages inside this chat and we can also
     continue messaging the ai assistant in the opened chat.
     or we can create a new conversation and store it also.
     ## note that all these stored locally using sqlite
     note:conversation=>messages

AI Integration: Use OpenAI or similar APIs for conversational capabilities.
Task Management: Users can add, update, or delete tasks.
Weather Updates: Fetch weather data using a weather API.
Voice Input/Output: Enable speech-to-text for inputs and text-to-speech for responses.
